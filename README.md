# SpecTaint

Here are my archive of the [source code](https://github.com/enlighten5/SpecTaint) and [benchmarks](https://github.com/enlighten5/SpecTaint_benchmark).

This repo has not been updated since SpecTaint is not very user-friendly yet. There are some hardcoded code to set up this tool.

Feel free to checkout the source code and try it by yourself.
